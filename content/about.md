OpenMLRL focuses on reproducible machine learning for robotics and long-horizon
reasoning. The goal of this site is to document:

- Reference implementations and design notes for the **CoMLRL** stack
- Live infrastructure experiments and lab automation workflows
- Benchmarks that stress-test multi-agent reasoning loops
- Community field weeks, demonstrations, and contributor spotlights

The gallery is intentionally minimal. Each album is a snapshot of a working
project so that contributors can quickly scan what changed, follow links to the
source material, and plan the next iteration.
