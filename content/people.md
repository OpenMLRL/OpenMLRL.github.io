### Core researchers
- **Systems leads** steward the reinforcement learning stack, keep the multi-agent playground reproducible, and document design decisions for future cohorts.
- **Collaboration leads** translate fresh MARL results into large language model workflows—pairing reasoning agents with retrieval, planning, and critique tools.
- **Infrastructure partners** maintain the shared evaluation bedrock, from TPU clusters to instrumentation that tracks how autonomous tools behave alongside static models.

### How we work
We co-author RFCs in CoMLRL, prototype quickly in notebooks, and move promising ideas into the gallery as soon as they run end to end. Contributors rotate between agent training, evaluation science, and system orchestration so every release reflects real coordination pressure.

If you would like to collaborate, open an issue on GitHub or reach out at `hello@openmlrl.org` with a short note about the agent behaviors or toolchains you are interested in stress testing.
